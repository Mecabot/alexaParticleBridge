Instructions and sample code to connect Amazon Echo Alexa to Particle.io API

You will need a free Amazon account and membership in the Amazon developer
program to create the needed Alexa SKill Kit and Lambda components.
You will also need a Particle.io account, and compatible Arduino to connect with,
such as the Particle.io Photon (or soon the Digistump Oak).
